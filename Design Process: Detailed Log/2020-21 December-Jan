(12/26) 
- Did projects 1 and 2 from the arduino book. It was a simple series and parallel circuit and a flashing lights circuit with simple programs respectively.

(12/27) 
- Did projects 3 and 4 from the arduino book. It was a temperature sensor system turning on lights and respectively.

(1/6) 
- I started making my own project where it cycles between two different types of led flashing patterns after pushing a button
    - It is only running one cycle and not the other and I’m not too sure why
      - Missed another equal sign and added an extra ; to the else
    - Now my arduino isn’t working correctly
      - Lmao wrong rail
    - That took so much time and i’m uncomfortable knowing that
    - I want to make it so that its like a switch and I want to add some sort of analog input

(1/9) 
- I realized I don’t know enough of the basics to make an actually compelling project
  - I just practiced a bit of programming without heavily relying on looking off a reference
  - I want to make a push button function like a toggle switch but Idk whats happening program wise
  - Just started making the circuit for project 5

(1/11) 
- I finished the circuit and code for project 5
  - It reads the position of a potentiometer and translates that into the position the motor should move
