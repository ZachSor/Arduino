## Arduino

I got inspired to get into Arduino because of Micheal Reeves but also because of VEX. I have always built robots but never understood the coding aspect 
or if I had to wire everything up from scratch and I figured that this would be the best way of doing this. Also there are a lot of things you can do 
with an Arduino that aren't limited to simple circuits but you have to start small to get to comprehend more complex things.
